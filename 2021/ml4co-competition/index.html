					The Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization (ML4CO)
					NeurIPS 2021
					competition aims at improving state-of-the-art combinatorial
					optimization solvers by replacing key <b>heuristic components</b>
					with <b>machine learning models</b>.
					It exposes several control tasks arising in the open-source
					solver <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/">SCIP</a> as open
					challenges for ML, exposed via a unified OpenAI-gym API
					through the Python library
					<a href="https://www.ecole.ai/">Ecole</a>.

				<p>
					While most combinatorial optimization solvers are presented
					as a general-purpose, <em>one-fit-all</em> algorithm, the
					ML4CO competition focuses on the design of
					<b>application-specific algorithms</b> from historical data.
					This general problem captures a highly practical scenario
					relevant to many application areas, where a practitioner
					repeatedly solves problem instances from a specific
					distribution, with redundant patterns and characteristics. 
					For example, managing a large-scale energy
					distribution network requires solving very similar CO
					problems on a daily basis, with a fixed power grid
					structure while only the demand changes over time. This
					change of demand is hard to capture by hand-engineered
					expert rules, and ML-enhanced approaches offer a possible
					solution to detect typical patterns in the demand history.
					Other examples include crew scheduling problems that have
					to be solved daily or weekly with minor variations, or
					vehicle routing where the traffic conditions change over
					time, but the overall transportation network does not.

					The competition's purpose is to ask the following

					To answer that question, participants will be evaluated on
					<b>three problem
					benchmarks</b> originating from diverse application areas,
					represented as three collections of <b>mixed-integer
					linear programs</b> (MILPs).
					Benchmark-specific submissions are encouraged (algorithms
					or trained ML models), but of course generic submissions

			<h2>Primal task - Finding feasible solutions</h2>

			<p>
				The primal task deals with finding good <b>primal solutions</b>
				at the root node of the branch-and-bound tree. To that end,
				the environment (SCIP solver) will not perform any branching
				but will enter an infinite loop at the root node, which will
				collect the agent's solutions, evaluate their
				feasibility, and update the overall best solution reached so
				far, thus lowering the current <b>primal bound</b> (upper bound).
				The metric of interest for this task is the primal integral,
				which takes into account the speed at which the primal bound
				decreases over time. To model a realistic scenario, each problem
				instance will have been preprocessed by SCIP (problem
				reduction, cutting
				planes etc.), and the root linear program (LP) relaxation will have
				been solved before the participants are asked to produce
				feasible solutions.
				To prevent SCIP from searching for primal solutions by itself,
				all primal heuristics will be deactivated.
				A feasible, trivial solution
				will be provided to SCIP at the very beginning of the solving
				process to compute the primal integral unambiguously.

			<h2>Dual task - Branching</h2>

			<p>
				The dual task deals with obtaining tight optimality guarantees
				(dual bounds) via branching. Making good <b>branching decisions</b>
				is regarded as a critical component of modern branch-and-bound
				solvers, yet has received little theoretical understanding to
				this day (see <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11750-017-0451-6">Lodi et al., 2017</a>).
				In this task, the environment will run a full-fledged
				branch-and-cut algorithm with SCIP, and the participants
				will only control the solver's branching decisions. The metric
				of interest is the dual integral,
				which takes into account the speed at which the
				<b>dual bound</b> increases over
				time. Also, all primal heuristics will be
				deactivated, and the optimal primal solution value will be
				given to SCIP at the start of the solving process (as a
				cutoff bound), so that the focus is only on proving
				optimality via branching, and not on finding feasible solutions.

			<h2>Configuration task - Choosing solver parameters</h2>

			<p>
				The configuration task deals with deciding on a good
				<b>parameterization</b> of the solver for a given problem instance.
				The environment required for this task is more straightforward
				than for the two previous ones since it involves only a single
				decision for the agents (i.e., contextual bandit problem).
				Participants are allowed to tune any of the existing parameters
				of SCIP. They can choose between providing a fixed set of
				parameters that work well on average for each problem
				benchmark or producing instance-specific parameterizations
				based on each instance's characteristics. The metric of
				interest for this task is the <b>primal-dual gap</b> integral,
				which combines both improvements from the dual and from the
				primal side over time.

				<h2>Metrics</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Each of our three challenges, the primal task, the
				dual task and the configuration task,
				is associated to a specific <b>evaluation metric</b>
				that reflects a different objective. Here we describe how each
				metric is computed over a single problem instance, while the final
				goal of the participants is to optimize this metric in
				expectation over a <b>hidden collection of test instances</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because our evaluation metrics are
				time-dependent, evaluations will all be run on the same
				hardware setup, including one CPU core and one GPU card,
				which will be communicated at the start of the competition.
				For practical reasons, for each task, a maximum <b>time
				budget</b> of \(T=15\) minutes is given to process each test instance,
				after which the environment necessarily terminates.
				Participants should therefore focus on taking both
				<b>good and fast decisions</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Note: for simplicity in the following we consider MILPs expressed as minimization problems, without loss of generality.</em>
			</p>
			<dl class="description">
				<dt>
					Primal integral
				</dt>
				<dd>
					This evaluation metric measures the area under the curve of
					the solver's <b>primal bound</b> (a.k.a.
					global upper bound), which corresponds to the value of
					the best feasible solution found so far. By providing
					better solutions over time, the value of the primal bound
					decreases. To compute this metric unambiguously, a trivial
					initial solution \(x^0\) s always be provided to SCIP.
					The primal integral then expresses as:
					\[
					    \int_{t=0}^{T} \mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x}^\star_t\;\mathrm{d}t
					    \text{,}
					\]
					where \(\mathbf{x}^\star_t\) is the best solution found at
					time \(t\), \(\mathbf{c}\) is the MILP linear objective, and
					\(T\) is the solving time limit. The primal integral is to be minimized, and
					takes a minimal value of \(T\mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x}^\star\)
					for each problem instance, with \(\mathbf{x}^\star\) the
					optimal solution value for that instance.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Dual integral
				</dt>
				<dd>
					This objective measures the area under the curve of the
					solver's <b>dual bound</b> (a.k.a. global lower bound),
					which usually corresponds to a solution of a valid
					relaxation of the MILP. By branching, the LP relaxations
					corresponding to the branch-and-bound tree leaves get
					tightened, and the dual bound increases over time. In the
					context of branching, this metric is unambiguous to
					compute, as the root node of the tree always provides an
					initial dual bound. The dual integral then expresses as:
					\[
					    \int_{t=0}^{T} \mathbf{z}^\star_t\;\mathrm{d}t
					    \text{,}
					\]
					where \(\mathbf{z}^\star_t\) is the best dual bound at
					time \(t\). The dual integral is to be maximized and takes
					a maximal value of \(T\mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x}^\star\) for
					each problem instance, with \(\mathbf{x}^\star\) the optimal
					solution value for that instance.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Primal-dual gap integral
				</dt>
				<dd>
					This objective measures the area between two curves, the 
					solver's <b>primal bound</b> and the solver's
					<b>dual bound</b>. In the context of algorithm
					configuration, an initial value is required for these
					two curves at time \(t=0\). Therefore we provide both an
					initial trivial solution and a valid initial dual bound to
					SCIP for this task. The primal-dual gap integral then
					expresses as:
					\[
					    \int_{t=0}^{T} \mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x}^\star_t - \mathbf{z}^\star_t\;\mathrm{d}t
					    \text{.}
					\]
					The primal-dual gap integral is to be minimized and takes
					an optimal value of 0.
